Rambus Security,   Vught, Netherlands 

•	Senior Individual contributor, responsible for the design and development of robust algorithms for applications and device drivers for cryptographic embedded IPs which are part of the security protocol engines.

•	Designed and developed a power-optimized system software stack for Cryptographic embedded IPs.

Senior Lead Engineer                                                                                                                      Apr 2015 – Jul 2018
Qualcomm India Pvt. Limited,   Bengaluru, India 

•	Designed and developed Multicore, low power and random stress framework for ARM v8 based CPU subsystem. This software stack stresses all the CPU sub-system hardware interfaces to expose the functional, low power and coherency bugs in pre-silicon and post-silicon phases.

•	Automated the execution of performance analysis on newer CPU designs. This helps to ease the porting of Linux Kernel to newer SoC designs and reduces the overall effort to analyze various benchmarks.

•	Analyzed and benchmarked the CPU Sub-system using industry-standard benchmarks and use cases to identify performance bottlenecks and explore techniques to optimize them. Benchmarking and analysis are carried out on the emulation platform (pre-silicon) and post-silicon platforms by porting the Linux operating system.

Intel Mobile Communications India Pvt. Limited,   Bengaluru, India 

•	Designed and developed device driver and power optimized software stack for system on-chip FM Radio transceiver device for Windows OS, Android and Threadx RTOS on various Intel mobile phone chipsets.

•	Developed software quality plans, test design specifications and test cases for FM Radio framework aligning to test driven development methodology, unit testing and code coverage.

•	Collaborated with customers and internal functional teams to achieve the Audio and FM Radio device power management targets and devised solution for issues on system performance and power optimization at chip and platform-level.

Staff Software Engineer                                                                                                                           Apr 2007 – Nov 2009
TES Electronics Solutions India Pvt. Limited,   Bengaluru, India

•	Developed and maintained Power Management and control driver software for Threadx RTOS.

•	Refactored the power management framework to address the concerns of portability, maintainability, and configurability by introducing concepts such as modularization, code, and data separation. 

This helped in easier maintenance, configuration and faster integration of the power management framework and control drivers on new platforms and brought down the production issues by at least 40%. Earned recognition as an exceptional contributor and received a special bonus for this contribution.

Project Intern                                                                                                                                               Nov 2006 – Apr 2007
Indian Space Research Organization, [ISAC – ISRO],   Bengaluru, India 

•	Designed and implemented a loadable Linux device driver module on x86 based platform for a telemetry data acquisition card based on PCI evaluation board model MXSVFA-PCIDAQ-003 with data acquisition core. OS Driver supports the acquisition of data on digital and analog channels achieving a maximum data transfer rate of 10K samples/sec.
